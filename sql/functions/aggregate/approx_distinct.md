# APPROX_DISTINCT

## Description
The `APPROX_DISTINCT` function returns an approximate count of distinct values in a column using the HyperLogLog algorithm. This function is significantly faster and uses less memory than exact COUNT(DISTINCT) for large datasets, making it ideal for big data analytics where an exact count is not required. The typical error rate is around 2-3%.

## Syntax
```sql
APPROX_DISTINCT(expression)
```

### Parameters
- **expression**: A column or expression of any data type

### Return Value
- **Type**: BIGINT
- **Description**: An approximate count of distinct values. The error rate is typically Â±2-3% with 97% confidence.

## Example

### Sample Data
Consider the following `web_analytics` table tracking website visits:

| visit_id | user_id | page_url           | session_id | country | timestamp           |
|----------|---------|-------------------|------------|---------|---------------------|
| 1        | U001    | /home             | S001       | USA     | 2024-03-01 10:00:00 |
| 2        | U002    | /products         | S002       | UK      | 2024-03-01 10:01:00 |
| 3        | U001    | /products         | S001       | USA     | 2024-03-01 10:02:00 |
| 4        | U003    | /home             | S003       | Canada  | 2024-03-01 10:03:00 |
| 5        | U002    | /checkout         | S002       | UK      | 2024-03-01 10:04:00 |
| ... millions more rows ... |

### Query
```sql
-- Compare approximate vs exact counts
SELECT 
    APPROX_DISTINCT(user_id) AS approx_unique_users,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS exact_unique_users,
    ABS(APPROX_DISTINCT(user_id) - COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)) AS difference,
    ROUND(ABS(APPROX_DISTINCT(user_id) - COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)) * 100.0 / 
          COUNT(DISTINCT user_id), 2) AS error_percentage,
    APPROX_DISTINCT(session_id) AS approx_unique_sessions,
    APPROX_DISTINCT(page_url) AS approx_unique_pages
FROM web_analytics
WHERE timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

### Result
| approx_unique_users | exact_unique_users | difference | error_percentage | approx_unique_sessions | approx_unique_pages |
|--------------------|-------------------|------------|------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 98547              | 100234            | 1687       | 1.68             | 245890               | 1523              |

        APPROX_DISTINCT(user_id) AS approx_count,
        CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS approx_end_time
    FROM large_events_table
)
SELECT 
    exact_count,
    approx_count,
    ABS(exact_count - approx_count) AS difference,
    ROUND((exact_count - approx_count) * 100.0 / exact_count, 2) AS error_rate_pct,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (exact_end_time - start_time)) AS exact_time_seconds,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (approx_end_time - exact_end_time)) AS approx_time_seconds
FROM timing_comparison;
```

## Accuracy Considerations

```sql
-- Understanding accuracy at different scales
WITH accuracy_test AS (
    SELECT 
        cardinality_range,
        exact_distinct,
        approx_distinct,
        ABS(exact_distinct - approx_distinct) AS absolute_error,
        ROUND(ABS(exact_distinct - approx_distinct) * 100.0 / exact_distinct, 2) AS relative_error_pct
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            CASE 
                WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) < 1000 THEN '< 1K'
                WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) < 10000 THEN '1K-10K'
                WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) < 100000 THEN '10K-100K'
                WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) < 1000000 THEN '100K-1M'
                ELSE '> 1M'
            END AS cardinality_range,
            COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS exact_distinct,
            APPROX_DISTINCT(user_id) AS approx_distinct
        FROM events
        GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', event_time)
    ) daily_stats
)
SELECT 
    cardinality_range,
    AVG(relative_error_pct) AS avg_error_pct,
    MAX(relative_error_pct) AS max_error_pct,
    MIN(relative_error_pct) AS min_error_pct
FROM accuracy_test
GROUP BY cardinality_range
ORDER BY cardinality_range;
```

## Combining with Other Aggregates

```sql
-- Use with other aggregate functions
SELECT 
    product_category,
    COUNT(*) AS total_sales,
    APPROX_DISTINCT(customer_id) AS unique_customers,
    APPROX_DISTINCT(product_id) AS unique_products,
    SUM(sale_amount) AS total_revenue,
    SUM(sale_amount) / NULLIF(APPROX_DISTINCT(customer_id), 0) AS revenue_per_customer,
    COUNT(*) / NULLIF(APPROX_DISTINCT(customer_id), 0) AS orders_per_customer
FROM sales
WHERE sale_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
GROUP BY product_category
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

## Memory Efficiency Example

```sql
-- Demonstrate memory efficiency for large-scale distinct counts
-- This would be memory-intensive with exact COUNT(DISTINCT)
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('day', event_time) AS day,
    APPROX_DISTINCT(user_id) AS daily_users,
    APPROX_DISTINCT(ip_address) AS unique_ips,
    APPROX_DISTINCT(user_agent) AS unique_user_agents,
    APPROX_DISTINCT(CONCAT(user_id, '::', session_id)) AS unique_user_sessions
FROM billions_of_events
WHERE event_time >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '365 days'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', event_time);
```
